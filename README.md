**Description of Data**
- The dataset that I used for my ps6 is about University/College Admissions and SAT & ACT scores in the US. More specifically, the purpose of this app is to determine whether or not standardized test scores (SAT and ACT) influences college admission rates. The main variables focused on are: Region, State, SATVR75, SATMT75, ACTEN75, and ACTMT75.

**Explanation of what the widgets and panels are doing**
- In the SAT and ACT plot pages, the widget can be used to alter the SAT or ACT scores. In other words, the SAT score ranges from 0 to 800 and the ACT score ranges from 0 to 36, and the user can use this feature to look on the plot admissions rate based on different test scores. Additionally, the side panels control the different Regions across the US, so the user can tick or untick regions to see on the plot the admissions rate over English & Math scores.
